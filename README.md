I am Dr. Hu Chuan-Peng, a new faculty member of the [School of Psychology](http://schools.njnu.edu.cn/psy/), [Nanjing Normal University](http://en.njnu.edu.cn/).

Here is [my personal website](https://huchuanpeng.com/).

This repo is to create my website. You can create similar personal website for yourself based on this repo too.

To do that, you need first install `blogdown` and `hugo-academic` theme. See [here](https://evamaerey.github.io/what_how_guides/academic_website_w_blogdown) for a quick start on blogdown. 

`install.packages("blogdown")`
`blogdown::install_hugo(force = TRUE)`

After that, run:
`blogdown::serve_site()`
