I am Dr. Hu Chuan-Peng, a faculty member of the [School of Psychology](http://schools.njnu.edu.cn/psy/), [Nanjing Normal University](http://en.njnu.edu.cn/). 

## Research
I am interested in how human beings process **self-related social information**, with a “3M” approach: meta-science, (cognitive) modeling, and (psychological) measurement. We are also trying to apply the “3M” approach to the mental health issues in the real world. 

### Open Dataset
**Dataset 1**: Data from the **Human Penguin Project** ([data](https://osf.io/h52d3/), [data descriptor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0029-2), [original study](https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.165)). 

**Dataset 2**: A dataset of cognitive ontology for neuroimaging studies of self-reference, which meta data extracted from all published fMRI studies that employed **self-referential paradigm** ([dataset](https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.j00001.00469), [data descriptor](https://doi.org/10.11922/11-6035.csd.2022.0047.zh)). These data can be used for coordinate-based meta-analyses of fMRI (e.g., [Hu et al., 2016](doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.12.003)) or other purposes.

**Dataset 3**: A Chinese **Social Evaluative Words** List ([data](https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.11640), [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/9cm7z/), [code](https://github.com/Chuan-Peng-Lab/SEVproject)), which include Chinese words that describe people's appearance,socioeconomic status, sociability, competence, and morality.

## Teaching
I am teaching three courses related to statistics. 

**Psychological Statistics《心理统计学》** for undergrads. All slide are prepared using `RMarkdown` and are avialable [here](https://github.com/Chuan-Peng-Lab/PsyStats). This course last for two semesters.

**Advanced Psychological Statistics《高级心理统计学》** for undergrads. This course focuses Bayesian statistics, I used [*Bayes Rules!*](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/) as the textbook but [`PyMC`](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) as the programming language.  All slide are prepared using `Jupyter Notebook` and are avialable [here](https://gitee.com/hcp4715/bayesian-analysis-nnupsy). This course is in the autumn-winter semester.

**R for Psychological Research《R语言在心理学研究中的应用》** for graduate students. This goal of this course is introducing [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) to more students in psychology. All slide are prepared using `RMarkdown` and are avialable [here](https://github.com/hcp4715/R4Psy). This course is in the spring-summer semester.

## Open science
I support Open Science and co-found [the Chinese Open Science Network](https://open-sci.cn/), please see our position paper in [AMPPS](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/25152459221144986) or [book chapter](https://osf.io/mw72e).
